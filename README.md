# FLStudio-MIDI-Devices
Custom MIDI devices for FL Studio using the MIDI Scripting Device API

## Installation
### FL Studio MIDI Scripts
Download the repository and copy the folder of your controller to the folder named `Settings/Hardware` in the user data folder. By default it's:
```bash
Windows:    C:\Users\USER\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware
Mac:        UNKNOWN, PLEASE ADD IF KNOWN
```
If you are brave enough you can also replace the `Hardware` folder by cloning this repository to this path. This is not tested and not recommended.
### Devices Firmware Settings
Some devices need some specific firmware settings that can be set with the shipped configuration software (see the software from the devices manufacturer). The corresponding settings files are found in the devices folder.

## Usage
In the devices folder you also find a separate `README.md` file which contains a documentation about what this script does and what features are implemented.
